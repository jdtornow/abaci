Abaci (pronounced abba-sigh) is a simple structure for the collection and reporting on numerical counters. Counters can be used to track time-based statistics for a wide array of functions within your application. Abaci uses a Redis backend to store all counters for lightning quick read and write access.

What does *abaci* mean? Its the plural form of [Abacus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abacus), a common arithmetic assistance device from before we had computers. Imagine that.

## Requirements

* Ruby 1.9.2+
* Redis

### Issues

If you have any issues or find bugs running Abaci, please [report them on Github](https://github.com/jdtornow/abaci/issues). While most functions should be stable, Abaci is still in its infancy and certain issues may be present.
